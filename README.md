This was going to be a utility named "JSON Grep", but I changed my mind. Instead
I went [full Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Naming) and named
it after myself. It contains tools, scripts, and configuration files for helping
to maintain my Node.js projects with as much autocracy as possible.

The non-interactive uses of this toolchain mainly include CI scripts, makefiles,
coverage reports, bootstrapping, and other similar tasks that require glue-code.
